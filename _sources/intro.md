Hello there 😄 Welcome to this Jupyter Book instance to document mainly data analysis workflows in the context of Cell Biology. 

Bellow some guidelines to get started using this amazing tool for Open Science 👇

## To reproduce an example of  Jupyter book, and you are a Windows user:


```{toggle} First! Try to reproduce this! Click the buttom to reveal :) 

The following workflow should succeed using a miniconda powershell terminal on Windows 10:

`Open Anaconda Power Shell Promt`

1. `conda install git`
2. `git clone https://github.com/eoas-ubc/quantecon-mini-example.git`
3. `cd quantecon-mini-example`
4. `git checkout windows`


Now, create the file : `environment_win.yml` with the following content

```yaml
name: wintest
channels:
  - default
  - conda-forge
  - eoas_ubc
dependencies:
  - python=3.7.*
  - sphinx=2.4.4
  - pip
  - runjb
  - git
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - pip:
    - quantecon
    - jupyter-book>=0.7.0b
```


5. `conda env create -f environment_win.yml`
6. `conda activate wintest`
7. `cd mini_book`
8. `runjb docs`

After the build, view the html with (local deployment):

`start docs\_build\html\index.html`

```

- For your own jupyter book just respect the same folder structure of the example, but with your own content! 

## How to deploy your book online? 

- Add a folder in the root of the repo called : `.github`
  - Add a subfolder called : `workflows`
  - Create a file called : `build.yml` where the instructions to GitHub to deploy your book are given. The following `build.yml` is generic as long as your **deploy Key** is called : `DEPLOY_KEY`. 

```yaml
name: Test Build
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - master
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout 🛎️
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: Setup Miniconda
        uses: goanpeca/setup-miniconda@v1
        with:
          auto-update-conda: true
          auto-activate-base: false
          miniconda-version: 'latest'
          python-version: 3.7
          environment-file: environment_win.yml
          activate-environment: wintest

      - name: Install jupyter_book
        shell: bash -l {0}
        run:  pip install jupyter-book --pre 


      - name: Build Jupyter Book
        shell: bash -l {0}
        run: jb build  mini_book/docs/

      - name: Install SSH Client 🔑
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.2.0
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
        


      - name: Deploy 🚀
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3
        with:
          SSH: true
          BRANCH: gh-pages
          FOLDER: mini_book/docs/_build/html/
          
```
- Create a new branch called : 'gh-pages'
- A public and private key just dedicated to this Jupyter Book repo 
- The content of the private key should be copied to the `Secrets` tab in the Settings of the repo. 
    - Create an SSH key with sufficient access privileges. For security reasons, don't use your personal SSH key but set up a dedicated one for use in GitHub Actions. Instructions 👇
    - Steps:
     1. Open Git Bash.
     2. Insert in bash `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"` This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.
     > Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.
    > Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]
    At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases".
    > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enter] 
    - Make sure you don't have a passphrase set on the private key.
    > Enter same passphrase again: [Press enter again]


- In your repository, go to the Settings > Secrets menu and create a new secret. In this example, we'll call it SSH_PRIVATE_KEY. Put the contents of the private SSH key file into the contents field.
- This key should start with `-----BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY-----`, consist of many lines and ends with `-----END ... PRIVATE KEY-----`.
- SSH private key format
    - If the private key is not in the PEM format, you will see an Error loading key `"(stdin)": invalid format message`.

    - Use `ssh-keygen -p -f path/to/your/key -m pem` to convert your key file to PEM, but be sure to make a backup of the file first 

- Add an empty file `.nojekyll` to the root of the repo to prevent github on deploying a jekyll website.
